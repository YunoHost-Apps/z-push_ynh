## Overview
Z-Push is an Exchange ActiveSync fronted written in PHP which lets you synchronize emails (IMAP/SMTP backend) and calendar/contacts (cardDAV and caldDAV backend)

**Shipped version:** 2.6.1

## Current status
- [x] Z-push for YunoHost supports IMAP sync and CardDAV/CalDAV sync if Ba√Økal or Nextcloud is installed
- [x] Ability to send calendar invitations
- [x] Use of push for emails, contacts and calendar
- [x] Sync States are now stored in /home/yunohost.app/$app
- [x] Logrotate has been activated as Z-Push can become noisy at times
- [x] Z-Push is now configured to use SMTP to send emails instead of php_mail() function. This let us have emails signed by dkim for example.
- [x] The current IMAP backend configuration seems able to handle email addresses different from login (for example login: john and email john.doe@domain.tld instead of john@domain.tld) - Further testing required!
- [x] The sources are based on http://download.z-push.org/final/
- [x] Autodiscover implemented
- [x] Use of version 2.5.2 final
